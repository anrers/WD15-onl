Thank you for your letter! I will answer your questions about my family with pleasure. 
Today is Sunday, so we are all together. It is raining, that's why we are all sitting in the living room. 
My Mom is reading. She is a teacher of literature, so she reads a lot. She is a slim woman of about 40. 
Her pupils like her for she is an going and a kind person. Reading is her hobby. Besides, she is fond of cooking. 
When
we gather together after a working day, there is always something tasty on the table. My father helps her sometimes 
with the house work. He is a doctor and has very little free time. He works a lot. When I was a child, I often visited 
him at the hospital and saw him at work. He always listens attentively to his patients and gives them his advice. 
His patients trust him and that makes his work easier. He decided to become a doctor, because his father, 
my grandfather, was a doctor too. They look very much alike. All my grandparents are retired now. They all live in 
the village, where my parents come from. They are happy to see the entire family when we come to them. We have many 
relatives. My aunts, uncles, and cousins live in different parts of Ukraine. On holidays we often gather together and 
have a very good time!
